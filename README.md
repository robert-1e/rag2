## Getting Started

Run `deno install` to install dependancies

Run `deno task dev` to open a dev server

Run something else to do something else (this is really just a quick project I want to chuck online, I'm not too worried about any professionalism)

## Other stuff

This is probably a bit cooked (in terms of the stack)
